Exchange.(fill in data) 

-----------------
Currency Exchange
-----------------

If the client is unable to remit payment through any of the service 
provider's task_payment_methods options, an escrow may be included in 
the transaction to facilitate exchange as a middleman between the two 
parties (e.g. ZEC to BTC). This would constitute an additional service 
with its own fees.

When using an escrow for exchange, the task_payment_methods offered by 
the escrow may be used instead of the service provider's, and it will be 
the responsibility of the escrow agent to properly channel the payment 
once received from the client.
